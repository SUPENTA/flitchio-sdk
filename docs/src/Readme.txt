ReST/Sphinx Errors & Warnings
=============================

global.rst & example.rst are not built in because they are listed in
"exclude_patterns" (see conf.py)

--

"Duplicate explicit target name:foo"

--

"WARNING: Block quote ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent."
Make sure to put blank lines *above* and *below* every block (also on the very
fst line.)

example.rst.txt contains examples of formatting. Also see http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html
