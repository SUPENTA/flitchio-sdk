Flitchio SDK for Unity 3D
-------------------------

Add the SDK to your project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Flitchio SDK for Unity 3D makes it easy to add Flitchio support to an existing Unity game or app.
In reality, it simply consists of the Flitchio SDK AAR file -- the one used in Android -- plus a few scripts to attach to your game objects to make them react to Flitchio.

The development is still in early stage: please refer to the `source and README <https://github.com/SUPENTA/flitchio-sdk/tree/master/unityPlugin>`_.
