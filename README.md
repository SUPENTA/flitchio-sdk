[Flitchio](https://flitch.io/) is the **first game controller built into a smartphone case**.

With its two analogue joysticks and two shoulder buttons at the back of the phone,
it frees your screen and gives you tangible controls. Play dozens of games, pilot drones, and more.

The Flitchio SDK enables you to enhance your existing apps and games by providing
**pressure-sensitivity and better accuracy**. You can also imagine and develop new kinds
of **immersive experiences** with this whole new user interface at the back of the phone.


**Info: this README is a mere introduction. Please find a [more complete documentation here](http://dev.flitch.io/).
It explains all the steps in details, from set up to troubleshooting.**
